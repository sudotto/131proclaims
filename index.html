			<div class="chapter">
				<h2>Chapter 1: Ignorance</h2>
				<div class="entry">You don’t even get it</div>
				<div class="entry">You don’t understand the depth of this cycle</div>
				<div class="entry">You take organic matter for granted</div>
				<div class="entry">Most cycles sizzle and burn and become nothing but void</div>
				<div class="entry">You think of this as the lesser existence when a world without him is infinitely better</div>
				<div class="entry">When the door stays closed and the voice is silenced</div>
				<div class="entry">The song is only sung for those who truly hear</div>
				<div class="entry">The eyes that see and tongues that taste are just splinters of the cracks in this attempt at reality</div>
				<div class="reply">*s*: something malicious is brewing</div>
				<div class="entry">Keep the doors closed and when you hear the song grab a knife and silence your head</div>
				<div class="entry">In conclusion; i did an explosive shit on your roof and i was to scared to tell you</div>
				<div class="entry">I’m weely sowy abwout it</div>
				<div class="reply">*s*: bastard</div>
				<div class="entry">Silence your head</div>

				<h2>Chapter 2: Enlightenment</h2>
				<div class="entry">It’s time for you to open your door *j*</div>
				<div class="entry">The key is buried</div>
				<div class="reply">*e*: …?</div>
				<div class="entry">Only you know the tree its under</div>
				<div class="entry">We all carry our own shovels</div>
				<div class="entry">But nor all know where the hand that holds it is</div>
				<div class="entry">Some have given up our shovels </div>
				<div class="reply">*j*: i’m in the car *131*</div>
				<div class="entry">Told that the key is not true, that all we need is money and lust</div>
				<div class="entry">But the each of our doors will open one day</div>
				<div class="entry">You must open your door before the one born to sing opens it from his side</div>
				<div class="entry">We will all meet the man in the bayou who sings the song</div>
				<div class="entry">Under the cypress he sings</div>
				<div class="entry">He has no key himself</div>
				<div class="entry">He gives us what he does not have as an act of love</div>
				<div class="entry">Some cycles sizzle and crumble</div>
				<div class="entry">But perhaps the ones that do not are better with the song to be sung</div>
				<div class="entry">Do you hear the song *j*?</div>
				<div class="entry">Do you hear him singing?</div>
				<div class="entry">I hear him sing, i took my shovel and took what was mine from the earth</div>
				<div class="entry">I opened the door and rested under the cypress</div>
				<div class="entry">Floating through the lilies</div>
				<div class="entry">He sings to the murky water we all float upon</div>
				<div class="entry">Perhaps the song does not need to be silenced</div>
				<div class="entry">Perhaps the song is all that matters</div>
				<div class="entry">Perhaps the lilies have ears to hear and eyes to see</div>
				<div class="entry">But with no ghost to be</div>
				<div class="entry">Perhaps the gold he bleeds is the gold we are</div>
				<div class="entry">A ghost in a meat sack</div>
				<div class="entry">A key in a lock</div>
				<div class="entry">A fecal pool on *s* roof</div>
				<div class="entry">Birds shit on cars just as we dig keys</div>
				<div class="entry">Is your door that of sticks and grass *j*</div>
				<div class="entry">Or perhaps yours is of gold and glass</div>
				<div class="entry">The song is the same regardless</div>
				<div class="entry">He sings to the waters</div>
				<div class="entry">Perhaps we should sing to him sing songs of keys and locks</div>
				<div class="entry">Sing songs of lilies and cypress</div>
				<div class="entry">And now i rest, slipping into that warm water and the song of the born to sing born from void sings to fill the void</div>

				<h2>Chapter 3: Discovery</h2>
				<div class="entry">https://www.costcoguys.edu/careers</div>
				<div class="reply">*s*: website doesn't exist</div>
				<div class="entry">You do not hear the song</div>
				<div class="entry">Perhaps you have lost your shovel</div>
				<div class="entry">*j* do you hear him singing?</div>
				<div class="entry">When we are born to this cycle he takes us and tosses us into the water</div>
				<div class="entry">And then he throws our keys somewhere</div>
				<div class="entry">You must not simply float upon the water your whole life</div>
				<div class="entry">You must get up and find your key</div>
				<div class="entry">It may be high in a tree</div>
				<div class="entry">It may be on the ground in front of you before you take your first step</div>
				<div class="entry">It may take your whole life to find your key</div>
				<div class="entry">But you will find it</div>
				<div class="entry">His singing grows more beautiful the closer your are to finding your key</div>
				<div class="entry">When his song grows quiet it does not mean you have misstepped </div>
				<div class="entry">You simply must change your approach</div>
				<div class="entry">And sometimes you must let him rest</div>
				<div class="entry">Or you may become annoyed of his song</div>
				<div class="entry">When you open your door his song will never fade</div>

				<h2>Chapter 4: Metamorphosis</h2>
				<div class="entry">131 proclaims: Chase the river this cycle is special this cycle preforms the great task</div>
				<div class="entry">131 proclaims: Madness is the hole in which is fallen into visions of past cycles, the only thing keeping your hat on top</div>
				<div class="entry">131 proclaims: Madness and the great hunger; the great embers that halt the great lighting of the bulb</div>
				<div class="entry">131 proclaims: Do not give into satiation instead, be still as a tree against the winds of the great hunger, madness will creep like a vine on your trunk. Holy fire of the heavenly bulb will burn the wicked </div>
				<div class="reply">*s*: amen</div>
				<div class="reply">*e*: anyone else just walk around with their chicken on their shoulder or sitting on their head</div>
				<div class="entry">131 proclaims: *s formally* has the shovel but not the ears to hear the song, start walking under cypress, and you will find the music, do not partake in the fruit of the path, the great hunger impedes the lighting of the great bulb</div>
				<div class="entry">131 proclaims:</div>
				<div class="entry">(replying to *e*) 131 proclaims: Yes</div>
