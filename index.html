					<h3>Chapter 1: Ignorance</h3>
					<p>the speaker describes their distain towards the functions of the universe, preaching falsehoods of silencing the song unsung</p>
					<div class="entry">You don’t even get it</div>
					<div class="entry">You don’t understand the depth of this cycle</div>

					<div class="entry">You think of this as the lesser existence when a world without him is infinitely better</div>
					<div class="entry">When the door stays closed and the voice is silenced</div>
					<div class="entry">The song is only sung for those who truly hear</div>
					<div class="entry">The eyes that see and tongues that taste are just splinters of the cracks in this attempt at reality</div>
					<div class="reply">[white chocolate]: something malicious is brewing</div>

					<h3>Chapter 2: Enlightenment</h3>
					<p>since Ignorance, the speaker has now heard the beauty of the song, and has unlocked their door, the speaker now urges everyone to follow as well</p>
					<div class="entry">It’s time for you to open your door [lemur king]</div>
					<div class="entry">The key is buried</div>
					<div class="reply">[knock knock]: …?</div>
					<div class="entry">Only you know the tree its under</div>
					<div class="entry">We all carry our own shovels</div>
					<div class="entry">But nor all know where the hand that holds it is</div>
					<div class="entry">Some have given up our shovels </div>
					<div class="reply">[lemur king]: i’m in the car *speaker*</div>
					<div class="entry">Told that the key is not true, that all we need is money and lust</div>
					<div class="entry">But the each of our doors will open one day</div>
					<div class="entry">You must open your door before the one born to sing opens it from his side</div>
					<div class="entry">We will all meet the man in the bayou who sings the song</div>
					<div class="entry">Under the cypress he sings</div>
					<div class="entry">He has no key himself</div>
					<div class="entry">He gives us what he does not have as an act of love</div>
					<div class="entry">Some cycles sizzle and crumble</div>
					<div class="entry">But perhaps the ones that do not are better with the song to be sung</div>
					<div class="entry">Do you hear the song [lemur king]?</div>
					<div class="entry">Do you hear him singing?</div>
					<div class="entry">I hear him sing, i took my shovel and took what was mine from the earth</div>
					<div class="entry">I opened the door and rested under the cypress</div>
					<div class="entry">Floating through the lilies</div>
					<div class="entry">He sings to the murky water we all float upon</div>
					<div class="entry">Perhaps the song does not need to be silenced</div>
					<div class="entry">Perhaps the song is all that matters</div>
					<div class="entry">Perhaps the lilies have ears to hear and eyes to see</div>
					<div class="entry">But with no ghost to be</div>
					<div class="entry">Perhaps the gold he bleeds is the gold we are</div>
					<div class="entry">A ghost in a meat sack</div>
					<div class="entry">A key in a lock</div>
					<div class="entry">A fecal pool on [white chocolate]'s roof</div>
					<div class="entry">Birds shit on cars just as we dig keys</div>
					<div class="entry">Is your door that of sticks and grass [lemur king]</div>
					<div class="entry">Or perhaps yours is of gold and glass</div>
					<div class="entry">The song is the same regardless</div>
					<div class="entry">He sings to the waters</div>
					<div class="entry">Perhaps we should sing to him sing songs of keys and locks</div>
					<div class="entry">Sing songs of lilies and cypress</div>
					<div class="entry">And now i rest, slipping into that warm water and the song of the born to sing born from void sings to fill the void</div>

					<h3>Chapter 3: Discovery</h3>
					<p>the speaker has learned more about the bayou and the functions of the soul, they now confront their true meaning and path for this cycle</p>
					<div class="entry">https://www.costcoguys.edu/careers</div>
					<div class="reply">[white chocolate]: website doesn't exist</div>
					<div class="entry">You do not hear the song</div>
					<div class="entry">Perhaps you have lost your shovel</div>
					<div class="entry">[lemur king] do you hear him singing?</div>
					<div class="entry">When we are born to this cycle he takes us and tosses us into the water</div>
					<div class="entry">And then he throws our keys somewhere</div>
					<div class="entry">You must not simply float upon the water your whole life</div>
					<div class="entry">You must get up and find your key</div>
					<div class="entry">It may be high in a tree</div>
					<div class="entry">It may be on the ground in front of you before you take your first step</div>
					<div class="entry">It may take your whole life to find your key</div>
					<div class="entry">But you will find it</div>
					<div class="entry">His singing grows more beautiful the closer your are to finding your key</div>
					<div class="entry">When his song grows quiet it does not mean you have misstepped </div>
					<div class="entry">You simply must change your approach</div>
					<div class="entry">And sometimes you must let him rest</div>
					<div class="entry">Or you may become annoyed of his song</div>
					<div class="entry">When you open your door his song will never fade</div>

					<h3>Chapter 4: Metamorphosis</h3>
					<p>after confronting their new path, the speaker preaches about the discoveries made, donning their new name of 131, they share songs of the evils that are faced upon the path of the bayou</p>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: Chase the river this cycle is special this cycle preforms the great task</div>

					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: Do not give into satiation instead, be still as a tree against the winds of the great hunger, madness will creep like a vine on your trunk. Holy fire of the heavenly bulb will burn the wicked </div>
					<div class="reply">[white chocolate]: amen</div>
					<div class="reply">[knock knock]: anyone else just walk around with their chicken on their shoulder or sitting on their head</div>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: [white chocolate] has the shovel but not the ears to hear the song, start walking under cypress, and you will find the music, do not partake in the fruit of the path, the great hunger impedes the lighting of the great bulb</div>

					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: the great hunger has captured you all in its vines twisting and turning, choking the life from your soul, call upon the holy fire of the great bulb and cast out the wicked</div>

					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: but the fruit of nothingness doesn't only bear paradise, this cycle has birthed flame and hunger, consuming and destroying, dimming the great bulb, other cycles with paradise have not had this, perhaps the great bulb can only be lit by conflict as we know it to be</div>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: led by lebron we will take up saxabooms just like jack black and sing songs of victory over the great hunger, once the bulb is lit and hunger becomes myth only then will every cycle collapse into one and we will see a world beyon the limits of spatial logic</div>
