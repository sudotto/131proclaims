					<h3>Chapter 1: Ignorance</h3>
					<p>the speaker describes their distain towards the functions of the universe, preaching falsehoods of silencing the song unsung</p>
					<div class="entry">You don’t even get it</div>
					<div class="entry">You don’t understand the depth of this cycle</div>
					<div class="entry">You take organic matter for granted</div>
					<div class="entry">Most cycles sizzle and burn and become nothing but void</div>
					<div class="entry">You think of this as the lesser existence when a world without him is infinitely better</div>
					<div class="entry">When the door stays closed and the voice is silenced</div>
					<div class="entry">The song is only sung for those who truly hear</div>
					<div class="entry">The eyes that see and tongues that taste are just splinters of the cracks in this attempt at reality</div>
					<div class="reply">*s*: something malicious is brewing</div>
					<div class="entry">Keep the doors closed and when you hear the song grab a knife and silence your head</div>
					<div class="entry">In conclusion; i did an explosive shit on your roof and i was to scared to tell you</div>
					<div class="entry">I’m weely sowy abwout it</div>
					<div class="reply">*s*: bastard</div>
					<div class="entry">Silence your head</div>
				</div>
				<div id="b1c2" class="chapter">
					<h3>Chapter 2: Enlightenment</h3>
					<p>since Ignorance, the speaker has now heard the beauty of the song, and has unlocked their door, the speaker now urges everyone to follow as well</p>
					<div class="entry">It’s time for you to open your door *j*</div>
					<div class="entry">The key is buried</div>
					<div class="reply">*e*: …?</div>
					<div class="entry">Only you know the tree its under</div>
					<div class="entry">We all carry our own shovels</div>
					<div class="entry">But nor all know where the hand that holds it is</div>
					<div class="entry">Some have given up our shovels </div>
					<div class="reply">*j*: i’m in the car *speaker*</div>
					<div class="entry">Told that the key is not true, that all we need is money and lust</div>
					<div class="entry">But the each of our doors will open one day</div>
					<div class="entry">You must open your door before the one born to sing opens it from his side</div>
					<div class="entry">We will all meet the man in the bayou who sings the song</div>
					<div class="entry">Under the cypress he sings</div>
					<div class="entry">He has no key himself</div>
					<div class="entry">He gives us what he does not have as an act of love</div>
					<div class="entry">Some cycles sizzle and crumble</div>
					<div class="entry">But perhaps the ones that do not are better with the song to be sung</div>
					<div class="entry">Do you hear the song *j*?</div>
					<div class="entry">Do you hear him singing?</div>
					<div class="entry">I hear him sing, i took my shovel and took what was mine from the earth</div>
					<div class="entry">I opened the door and rested under the cypress</div>
					<div class="entry">Floating through the lilies</div>
					<div class="entry">He sings to the murky water we all float upon</div>
					<div class="entry">Perhaps the song does not need to be silenced</div>
					<div class="entry">Perhaps the song is all that matters</div>
					<div class="entry">Perhaps the lilies have ears to hear and eyes to see</div>
					<div class="entry">But with no ghost to be</div>
					<div class="entry">Perhaps the gold he bleeds is the gold we are</div>
					<div class="entry">A ghost in a meat sack</div>
					<div class="entry">A key in a lock</div>
					<div class="entry">A fecal pool on *s* roof</div>
					<div class="entry">Birds shit on cars just as we dig keys</div>
					<div class="entry">Is your door that of sticks and grass *j*</div>
					<div class="entry">Or perhaps yours is of gold and glass</div>
					<div class="entry">The song is the same regardless</div>
					<div class="entry">He sings to the waters</div>
					<div class="entry">Perhaps we should sing to him sing songs of keys and locks</div>
					<div class="entry">Sing songs of lilies and cypress</div>
					<div class="entry">And now i rest, slipping into that warm water and the song of the born to sing born from void sings to fill the void</div>

					<h3>Chapter 3: Discovery</h3>
					<p>the speaker has learned more about the bayou and the functions of the soul, they now confront their true meaning and path for this cycle</p>
					<div class="entry">https://www.costcoguys.edu/careers</div>
					<div class="reply">*s*: website doesn't exist</div>
					<div class="entry">You do not hear the song</div>
					<div class="entry">Perhaps you have lost your shovel</div>
					<div class="entry">*j* do you hear him singing?</div>
					<div class="entry">When we are born to this cycle he takes us and tosses us into the water</div>
					<div class="entry">And then he throws our keys somewhere</div>
					<div class="entry">You must not simply float upon the water your whole life</div>
					<div class="entry">You must get up and find your key</div>
					<div class="entry">It may be high in a tree</div>
					<div class="entry">It may be on the ground in front of you before you take your first step</div>
					<div class="entry">It may take your whole life to find your key</div>
					<div class="entry">But you will find it</div>
					<div class="entry">His singing grows more beautiful the closer your are to finding your key</div>
					<div class="entry">When his song grows quiet it does not mean you have misstepped </div>
					<div class="entry">You simply must change your approach</div>
					<div class="entry">And sometimes you must let him rest</div>
					<div class="entry">Or you may become annoyed of his song</div>
					<div class="entry">When you open your door his song will never fade</div>

					<h3>Chapter 4: Metamorphosis</h3>
					<p>after confronting their new path, the speaker preaches about the discoveries made, donning their new name of 131, they share songs of the evils that are faced upon the path of the bayou</p>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: Chase the river this cycle is special this cycle preforms the great task</div>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: Madness is the hole in which is fallen into visions of past cycles, the only thing keeping your hat on top</div>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: Madness and the great hunger; the great embers that halt the great lighting of the bulb</div>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: Do not give into satiation instead, be still as a tree against the winds of the great hunger, madness will creep like a vine on your trunk. Holy fire of the heavenly bulb will burn the wicked </div>
					<div class="reply">*s*: amen</div>
					<div class="reply">*e*: anyone else just walk around with their chicken on their shoulder or sitting on their head</div>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: *s formally* has the shovel but not the ears to hear the song, start walking under cypress, and you will find the music, do not partake in the fruit of the path, the great hunger impedes the lighting of the great bulb</div>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims:</div>
					<div class="entry">(replying to *e*) 131 proclaims: Yes</div>

					<h3>Chapter 1: True Sight</h3>
					<p>a month has past since the events of "Songs from the Bayou" and 131 has returned from a spiritual journey, rambling and screaming, the times have changed... this journey was not of spiritual awakening, but of witnessing horrors.</p>
					<div class="reply">*j*: you aren't real *131*</div>
					<div class="entry">(replying to *j*) you have lost your shovel</div>
					<div class="reply">*s*: 132 proclaims: evil *j2* is evil and is going to punish you</div>
					<div class="entry">(ramblings) helium is on helium is on helium is on helium is on helium is on</div>

					<div class="entry">(ramblings) my keys were taken</div>

					<h3>Chapter 2: The Promise</h3>
					<p></p>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: the great hunger has captured you all in its vines twisting and turning, choking the life from your soul, call upon the holy fire of the great bulb and cast out the wicked</div>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: i have walked through the foors of many since the songs of the bayou and i have seen many lands of beauty that others call paradise</div>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: the man in the bayou showed me that the diversity of paradise matters not, our differences only blind us from the truth that we are all one, we all float through the waters or walk through the fields</div>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: we must tear down the walls i may see cypress you may see clouds but we must accept that we dwell in the same place</div>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: but thr great hunger consumes our brothers and sisters, children of the great bulb captured and shrouded in void</div>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: hear me and do not mistake; the void is natural, the great default of the universe so empty that something bursts into life, this cycle with space and time which build our world to light the great bulb</div>
					<div class="reply">*s*: 131 proclaims: lebron james will give you backshots tonight</div>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: *s* is correct, lebron was born of paradise, and paradise born of void, from balls come lebrons fluid, just as from empty came something impregnating the void with the universe we know now</div>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: but the fruit of nothingness doesn't only bear paradise, this cycle has birthed flame and hunger, consuming and destroying, dimming the great bulb, other cycles with paradise have not had this, perhaps the great bulb can only be lit by conflict as we know it to be</div>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: led by lebron we will take up saxabooms just like jack black and sing songs of victory over the great hunger, once the bulb is lit and hunger becomes myth only then will every cycle collapse into one and we will see a world beyon the limits of spatial logic</div>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: we may rest with lebron james floating in gallons of crude oil which fill a basketball court like those warm waters of paradis</div>
				</div>
				<div id="b2c3" class="chapter">
					<h3>Chapter 3: The Death of Shame</h3>
					<p></p>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: all of you must fast, forgetting the shame of indulging in the great hunger</div>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: the main in the bayou said unto me; "shame is but a moment but the pain of defeat is eternal", it lasts unendingly beyond time until the bulb is lit and the cycles cease</div>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: in truth beyond this cycle lies no opposition, the power of reality only spreads when uncontained, the great bulb will light the walls of reality ablaze with holy fire</div>
					<div class="reply">*s*: 131 proclaims: little caesers pretzel crust pizza is back for limited time! get it now for only $6.99</div>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims:i have realized now that the cracks in reality the eyes that see and tongues that taste are not lies, do not silence your head, let your bones scream and shout, let your ghost wander from your chest and wage war against satiation</div>
					<div class="entry">131 proclaims: *s* you must have opened your door, you speak nothing but truth, you have seen the liver rental store and you have purchased freedom using a currency no man knows</div>
					<div class="entry">continue on this path speaking truths upon these sinners so that one day they might hear the song</div>
					<div class="entry">my brothers speaking not as 131 but as a child of the great bulb, the song has always been sung, since before this cycle and before the void bore fruit</div>
					<div class="entry">forget the shame of satiation and unsilence your head, let your blood sing songs of paradise however you see it</div>
